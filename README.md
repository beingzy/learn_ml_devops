## DevOps for Machine Learning
#### Introduction
In order to empower your services with latest feedback from users, engineers have to execute a set of multi-step operations on a continous basis. DevOps has become the de-facto development standard for cloud services. And, DevOps for AI/ML has the potential to stablize and streamline the model release process.
